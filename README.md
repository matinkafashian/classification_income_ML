# classification_income_ML
Overview
This project aims to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K/year based on various attributes. The dataset used for this classification task is the "Adult" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Several preprocessing steps are applied to the dataset, followed by the implementation of various machine learning models to perform the classification task. The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

Dataset
The "Adult" dataset contains 48,842 instances with 14 attributes. The attributes include age, workclass, education, marital-status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, capital-gain, capital-loss, hours-per-week, and native-country. The target variable is "income," which is a binary variable indicating whether an individual's income is ">50K" or "<=50K".

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of various machine learning algorithms for income classification. Through data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, we identified the most effective models and fine-tuned them to achieve optimal performance. The project showcases the importance of balancing the dataset and hyperparameter tuning in improving model accuracy.

Future Work
Future improvements can include:

Implementing more sophisticated feature engineering techniques.
Exploring deep learning models for classification.
Further fine-tuning the hyperparameters using more advanced techniques like Random Search or Bayesian Optimization.
Applying cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the models.
